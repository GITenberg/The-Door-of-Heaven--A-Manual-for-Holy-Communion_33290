PREFACE.
</H3>

<P>
This little Manual is intended for the use of young people, and is
therefore short and very simple.  The object of the compiler is to
place in the hands of candidates for Confirmation a little book that
may be a help to them in their daily life, as well as at the Service of
Holy Communion.
</P>

<P>
Grateful thanks are tendered to the holders of copyright for permission
to make use of the hymns printed at the end of the book.  Also, the
author begs to acknowledge ideas derived from examining similar
Manuals, especially "The Narrow Way," "Prayers for Boys," "Help to
Worship," and "Holy Communion" by Bishop How.
</P>

<P>
It is earnestly hoped that this little book may, with the blessing of
God, prove of service to those for whom it has been written, both in
helping their devotions, and in deepening their spiritual life.

FOREWORD
</H3>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
BY THE RIGHT REVEREND MacADAM HARDING,
<BR>
BISHOP OF QU'APPELLE.
</H4>

<P>
A little book that will help the young and busy people in North-West
Canada to pray earnestly, day by day, and regularly make a good
Communion, must receive a warm welcome from the Bishop of a Diocese
where the great majority of the people are both young and busy.
</P>

<P>
I know the earnest desire of the compiler to help our young men and
women to draw near to God in Prayer and Sacrament, and I hope many of
them will find herein the very assistance they need.

What evil words have I spoken?

O blessed Saviour, Who didst fast in the desert for forty days for our
sakes, and to set us a holy example of self-denial, grant that I may

that I may follow Thee in prayer and self-denial, and confessing my
sins to God, may be pardoned, through the same Jesus Christ our Lord.

PREPARATION FOR HOLY COMMUNION.
</H3>

<P>
St. Paul says, "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that
Bread, and drink of that Cup."
</P>

<P>
You must guard against the danger of coming carelessly and without
preparation to Holy Communion; so make a rule to always examine
yourself carefully before you come.
</P>

<P>
First kneel down and say:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
O God, Thou knowest everything that I have said, and thought, and done.
Help me now to examine myself, that I may see my sins and be sorry for
them.  Send Thy Holy Spirit into my heart to help me, for Jesus
Christ's sake.  Amen.
</P>

<P>
Then ask yourself:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
1.  Am I trying to love and serve God with all my heart?
</P>

<P>
2.  Have I fallen into any special sin, which is troubling my mind, and
keeping me back from God?
</P>

<P>
3.  Have I said my prayers reverently and carefully every night and
morning?
</P>

<P>
4.  Have I been to Church every Sunday, and kept the rest of the day as
I ought?
</P>

<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P15"></A>15}</SPAN>

<P>
5.  Have I tried to forgive any who may have done me a wrong?
</P>

<P>
6.  Have I done anything impure, or said anything impure, or encouraged
any impure thought?
</P>

<P>
7.  Have I been honest in everything?
</P>

<P>
8.  Have I always told the truth?
</P>

<P>
9.  Have I thought or spoken evil of another?
</P>

<P>
10.  Have I quarrelled with any one, or lost my temper?
</P>

<P>
11.  Is there any sin I am not willing to give up?
</P>

<P>
12.  Have I been regular in my times of receiving the Holy Communion?
</P>

<P>
Whenever you find you have been wrong, confess your fault to God, and
ask for his pardon; say:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
O Father Almighty, forgive me for this sin that I have committed, and
send down Thy Holy Spirit into my heart that I may do better in the
future, for Jesus Christ's sake.  Amen.
</P>

<P>
[<I>If you have any trouble in your mind, or cannot quiet your own
conscience, either from some sin that you have committed, or from doubt
as to whether you ought to come to Holy Communion, do not be afraid to
go to your Clergyman, and ask him to help you</I>.]
</P>

<P>
<I>Also on Saturday night or Sunday morning use the following Office of
Preparation</I>:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
Kneel down and say:&mdash;

our daily bread.  And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them
that trespass against us.  And lead us not into temptation, But deliver
us from evil.  Amen.
</P>

<P>
I am truly sorry, O Lord, that I have grieved Thee by my sins, and I
wish that my sorrow was far greater.  I am not worthy to be called Thy
child, but Thou art still my most merciful Father.  Make me to hate sin
and to long for holiness: for Jesus' sake.  Amen.
</P>

<P>
I love Thee, O my God, for all Thy mercy to me, and I desire to love
Thee more and more.  Let no earthly love possess my heart, so as to let
me forget Thee.  Give me Thy Holy Spirit that I may love Thee more
truly, for Jesus Christ's sake.  Amen.
</P>

<P>
O Heavenly Father, I am about to draw near to the most Holy Sacrament
of the Body and Blood of Thy dear Son.  Have mercy upon me; have mercy
upon me, for I am most unworthy.  But, O my God, look not upon my sin,
but look upon the Face of Thy Son.  Thy dear Son hath died that we may
come with boldness unto Thee.  Therefore I come.  Oh, may I so eat and
drink that I may be partaker of the Body and Blood of Christ to the
strengthening and refreshing of my soul, and may be one with Him
through the power of the Holy Spirit.  Hear me, and
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P17"></A>17}</SPAN>
accept me, O
most merciful Father, for the sake of the same my crucified Saviour.
Amen.

<I>Be careful to be at Church in good time, and while waiting for the

<P>
Cleanse Thou me, O Lord, from my secret faults, and mercifully pardon
my sins, that I may receive Thy holy gifts with a pure mind; through
Jesus Christ our Lord.  Amen.
</P>

<P>
Almighty and everlasting God, I come to the holy Sacrament of Thy dear
Son.  I draw near weak, to the Giver of Strength; unclean, to the
Fountain of Mercy; blind, to the Eternal Light; poor and needy, to the
Lord of heaven and earth.  I pray Thee, therefore, of Thy great
goodness, to have mercy upon me, that so I may receive the King of
kings, and Lord of lords, with such reverence and purity and faith, as
shall be for the health of my soul.  Let me now receive the Body and
Blood of Jesus my Lord, that I may be one Body and one Spirit with Him,
and ever remain among His members.  Grant this for the same Jesus
Christ's sake.  Amen.
</P>

<P>
I do not presume to come to Thy table, O merciful Lord, trusting in my
own righteousness, but in
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P18"></A>18}</SPAN>
Thy manifold and great mercies.  I am
not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under Thy table.  But
Thou art the same Lord, Whose property is always to have mercy: Grant
me therefore, gracious Lord, so to eat the Flesh of Thy dear Son Jesus
Christ, and to drink His Blood, that my sinful body may be made clean
by His Body, and my soul washed through His most precious Blood, and
that I may evermore dwell in Him and He in me.  Amen.

O Blessed Saviour Jesus Christ, not trusting in my own goodness, but in
Thy great merits, I desire to receive the holy Sacrament of Thy Body
and Blood.  I am stained with many sins; do Thou wash me in Thy
precious Blood.  I am faint and weary in my strife against sin; do Thou
refresh and strengthen me.  Give me perfect purity of soul and body;
drive from me all unholy thoughts, and keep me from every evil word and
deed.  Give me grace to draw near to this holy Sacrament with such
reverence and fear, such holy joy and fervent love, such sorrow for sin
and desires for holiness, that I may enjoy all the blessings and
receive all the benefits which Thou hast obtained for us through Thy
precious death.  Amen.

Produced by Al Haines

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
